# 🌐 CCTC Networking Module

Welcome to the **Networking Module** of the Cyber Common Technical Core (CCTC). This section focuses on building a strong foundation in computer networking concepts, protocols, and security practices. It serves as a structured archive of lessons, labs, and resources to support both classroom instruction and hands‑on exercises.

---

## 🎯 Purpose
The Networking Module is designed to:
- Introduce fundamental networking concepts and architectures  
- Explore protocols such as TCP/IP, UDP, and ICMP  
- Provide hands‑on labs for packet analysis, traffic capture, and socket programming  
- Develop practical skills in reconnaissance, tunneling, and covert channels  
- Strengthen understanding of network defense and traffic filtering
